# Julia's Fashion Extravaganza

Capsule Wardrobe thing my girlfriend wanted.

All the ones out there were somehow simultaenously overcomplicated and didn't work as intended. This one shows
you all the combinations. Every single one.

This is a very basic one, choose whatever categories you want (button labels don't actually enforce anything).
If you want an "optional" category then add in a blank image to your selections and it should do what you want.

Saving the images is just right clicking and selecting print, and save as pdf. The way these are structured is 
an array of divs each with images attached to them so its not as simple as downloading all images on the screen.
